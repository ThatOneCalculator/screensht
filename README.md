Utility to make Hyprland screenshots look pretty

Based on https://gist.github.com/arnvgh/01b204df3229ed8c41cfd6ed847bb545

I use this for my screenshots, some people ask how I make them so here it is

Uses:
- [`grimblast`](https://github.com/hyprwm/contrib/blob/main/grimblast/grimblast) for screenshotting
- `hyprctl` ([Hyprland](hyprland.org/)) for changing hyprland settings on the fly
- [`satty`](https://github.com/gabm/Satty) for optional screenshot editing
- [`imagemagick`](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for image processing
- [`wl-copy`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) for clipboard management (`wl-clipboard` and `wl-clipboard-rs` work)

Here's a screenshot of screensht using screensht:
